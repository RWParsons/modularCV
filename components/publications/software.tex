\begin{itemize}
    \item A wrapper R package which allows the user to quickly perform Monte Carlo simulations to estimate the cost-effectiveness of using a prediction model to assign a healthcare intervention.
    \item Can be used to determine whether or when a clinical prediction model or clinical decision support system may be feasible before development or implementation.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
    \item An R package that allows users to fit Bayesian spatial models.
    \item Draws samples from the direct sampling spatial prior model which is 100-1000 times faster than a traditional MCMC scheme.
\end{itemize}

\texttt{\href{https://github.com/RWParsons/simMetric}{simMetric}} \hfill \textbf{\href{https://cran.r-project.org/package=simMetric}{CRAN}  Jan 2022} \par
\begin{itemize}
    \item An R package that provides several useful metrics (and their Monte Carlo standard errors) for the assessment of statistical methods in simulation studies.
    \item This allows for easy integration with other simulation study frameworks and the tidyverse-style workflow.
\end{itemize}
