\begin{itemize}
    \item An R package that provides several useful metrics (and their Monte Carlo standard errors) for the assessment of statistical methods in simulation studies.
	\item Packaged up several functions that I made for some ongoing work (simulation study) into an R-package.
	\item Unlike other packages to evaluate simulation studies, this package exports the functions used to calculate metrics so that they can easily be used within a tidy workflow.
    \item This doesn't abstract as much away from the user and therefore allows for easier integration with other simulation study frameworks.
\end{itemize}
